This is a Minecraft mod built using the Fabric API. The mod adds new items to the game which have special effects.

## Features
- Thunder dropper: A new item that can be used to summon lightning strikes.
- Redstone jumper: A new item used to teleport the player to the desired location.
- Invisibility ring: A new item that makes the player invisible so mobs cannot attack.
- Damage throwback enchantment: A new enchantment that causes damage to be thrown back at the attacker.

## Usage

To use the three items, just right-click with the item in your hand. The invisibility ring will make the player invisible, the thunder dropper will summon a lightning strike, and the redstone jumper will teleport the player to the desired location.
